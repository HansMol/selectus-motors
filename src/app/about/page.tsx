            Consumer confidence is soft. Good stock is expensive and hard to find. Energy, staffing, and premises costs keep rising. And on top of all that, the platforms dealers depend on to sell cars are charging more, penalising prices they don't like, and deciding which listings get seen. Kerb exists to take that last part off the table.

            <p>
              Dealers are under real pressure — rising operating costs, cautious buyers, stock that's harder and more expensive to source. The platforms they depend on to sell cars are quietly making things worse: fees going up, algorithms deciding which listings get seen, pricing penalties for dealers who know their own market better than any platform does.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buyers aren't getting a better deal either. More listings, more noise, harder to know who to trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built Kerb to fix both sides of that. A marketplace that doesn't squeeze dealers on fees or game their listings — and that gives buyers a cleaner, more trustworthy way to find a car.

              Real Kerb Appeal isn't about paid rankings or platform games. It's what happens when the right buyer finds the right car, from a dealer they can trust — with nothing in the middle extracting value from both sides.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's the marketplace we're building. Not the biggest — the most trusted. A place dealers choose because it doesn't squeeze them, and buyers return to because what they see is real.
