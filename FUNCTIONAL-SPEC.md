# Kerb — Functional Specification

*Last updated: 2026-06-30 (rev 4 — security hardening: HTML injection fix, server-side company verification, API authentication gaps closed)*

---

## Overview

Kerb is a UK car marketplace. Verified dealers list their vehicles. Buyers search, find, and contact dealers directly. The platform never intermediates between buyer and dealer.

---

## User types

| User | Description |
|---|---|
| **Buyer** | Anonymous visitor. Searches listings, views detail pages, sends enquiry directly to dealer. No account required. |
| **Dealer** | Registered business. Managed via Clerk auth. Lists and manages vehicles. Receives buyer enquiries directly via phone/email. |
| **Admin** | Hans. No admin panel yet — managed via Supabase dashboard. |

---

## Buyer flows

### Search and browse
1. Land on homepage — sees latest live listings, make shortcuts, body type filter
2. Search by keyword (make/model) via hero search bar or `/search`
3. Filter by make, body type (search page)
4. Click listing card → listing detail page
5. Fill in enquiry form → submits to `/api/enquiries` → Resend email to dealer ✅
6. Sees dealer phone + email on detail page — can contact directly

### Listing detail page
- Shows: photos (if uploaded), year/make/model, price, key specs grid, description, dealer card with phone + email
- Enquiry form: name, email, phone (optional), message
- URL structure: `/cars/[id]` (listing UUID)

---

## Dealer flows

### Registration
1. Sign up via Clerk (`/sign-up`)
2. Redirected to `/dealers/register` — 3-step wizard:
   - Step 1: Personal details (name, email, phone)
   - Step 2: Business details — Companies House lookup auto-verifies registered UK companies. Manual entry also allowed.
   - Step 3: Specialisms (makes, inventory size, price range)
3. On submit: server re-verifies company status via Companies House API — never trusts client. `status: approved` only if Companies House confirms `active`. Otherwise `status: pending`.
4. Redirected to `/dashboard`

### Dashboard
- Stats: total listings, live count, average price, top listing
- Listings table: vehicle, price, mileage, status, date, edit link
- Verification badge: Companies House verified status
- Add listing button

### Add listing (`/dashboard/listings/new`)
Multi-step wizard:
- Step 1: Vehicle details (make, model, year, colour, body type, doors, fuel, transmission, engine size)
- Step 2: Description builder (condition, service history, features, MOT, recent work, issues)
- Step 3: Pricing, mileage, status (draft/live)
- Photos: cover slot + 5-column grid, drag-and-drop, bulk select, up to 20 ✅
- On submit: POST `/api/listings` → saved to Supabase

### Edit listing (`/dashboard/listings/[id]/edit`)
- Single-page form: all vehicle fields, pricing, mileage, description, status
- Photos: pre-loaded from database, same cover + grid UI, add more or remove ✅
- Save → PATCH `/api/listings/[id]` (includes updated photo array)
- Delete (with confirm) → DELETE `/api/listings/[id]`
- Both operations enforce dealer ownership — a dealer can only edit/delete their own listings

### Listing statuses
| Status | Visible to buyers? |
|---|---|
| `draft` | No |
| `live` | Yes |
| `sold` | No |
| `archived` | No |

## Billing model

- Free until first buyer enquiry
- First enquiry triggers: Stripe checkout session → billing link emailed to dealer
- Trial: free until 1st of following calendar month
- Plans: Solo £55/month · Pro £132/month
- Annual: 10 months paid, 12 listed. Switch to monthly before renewal — no forced rollover.

---

## Business rules

- Dealers must be Companies House verified (or manually approved) before listings go live
- A listing only appears on homepage/search if `status = 'live'`
- Edit and delete operations are scoped to the authenticated dealer's own listings
- All buyer enquiries route directly to the dealer's registered email — Kerb is never in the conversation

### Search integrity rule
Organic search results are ordered by relevance and recency only. No dealer can pay to rank above another. This is a founding charter commitment — never break this rule in code or product decisions.

## Security model

| Surface | Control |
|---|---|
| Dashboard + dealer routes | Clerk auth via middleware — hard redirect to `/sign-in` |
| `/api/listings`, `/api/dealers/register` | `auth()` check — 401 if no session |
| `/api/stripe/checkout` | `auth()` + dealer `clerk_user_id` match — prevents cross-account session creation |
| `/api/stripe/identity` | `auth()` — prevents unauthenticated identity session creation |
| `/api/companies-house` | `auth()` — prevents API key drain |
| `/api/listings/[id]` PATCH + DELETE | Ownership check — `dealer_id` must match the authenticated user's dealer |
| Company verification | Server-side Companies House call — client `companyStatus` is never trusted |
| Stripe webhook | Signature verified with `constructEvent` before processing |
| Identity webhook | Matches on `clerk_user_id` (not email) to prevent spoofing |
| Upload file types | Server allowlist: JPEG, PNG, WebP, HEIC only |
| Enquiry email HTML | All user-supplied strings HTML-escaped before insertion |
| Secrets | Service role key + all API keys server-only — never exposed to client |

---

## Background operations

### Companies House monthly monitor
- GitHub Actions cron: 1st of each month at 08:00 UTC
- Checks all approved dealers' company status against Companies House
- Updates `company_status` in Supabase if changed
- Sends alert email to `hans@kerb.autos` via Resend if any status changed
- Silence = all clear
